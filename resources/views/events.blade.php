                            <p>For a student getting admission in the best school/institute is always a dream. For fresh 
                                graduates it is always a big challenge to find his/her desired job. Some are really lucky 
                                enough to have a job; it’s likely that they are constantly looking for ways to stay on top 
                                of their roles. Also, getting involved in a career after the start of a retired life in the 
                                wish to contribute to the family or utilizing the time and skills, is a high demand among 
                                the defense personnel. Continuing professional development, working towards that promotion, 
                                or simply working to do their best every day, it’s tough to remain positive when the skies 
                                aren’t always sunny and the birds aren’t singing. </p>
